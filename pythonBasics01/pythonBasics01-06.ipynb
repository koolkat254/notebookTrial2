    "## Wrap-Up and Q&A\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recap of Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we covered the following important concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Using Jupyter Notebooks for Writing and Running Python Code\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebooks is a powerful tool that allows you to write and execute Python code in small, interactive cells.\n",
    "- We practiced how to run individual code cells and see the output immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Basic Python Syntax\n",
    "- **Comments**: We learned how to add comments in Python using the `#` symbol. Comments are useful for making notes in your code.\n",
    "- **Variables**: Variables are used to store information that you can use later. Python does not require explicit type declarations for variables.\n",
    "- **print() Function**: We used the `print()` function to display text and variables in the console output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Code Recap:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a comment\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"  # Variable assignment\n",
    "print(\"Hello, \" + name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Writing Your First Program: \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "- We wrote a simple **\"Hello, World!\"** program to print text to the console.\n",
    "- This is a traditional way of starting to learn any programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Open Q&A\n",
    "- Do you have any questions about the topics we covered today?\n",
    "- Are there any areas that you would like to clarify?\n",
    "- Is there anything you'd like to explore further?\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to ask any questions as we wrap up today's session!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Python's Simplicity for Beginners\n",
    "- Python’s simple syntax and readability make it a great first programming language.\n",
    "- It doesn’t require complex declarations, which allows beginners to focus on understanding the core logic and concepts.\n",
    "- There is also a large community and vast libraries to support learning and building applications in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep experimenting with your code, and practice writing small programs. Python makes it easy to learn step by step!\n"
